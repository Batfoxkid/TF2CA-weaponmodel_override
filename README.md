# Custom Weapon Models

Custom Attribute using Nosoop's [custom attributes framework](https://github.com/nosoop/SM-TFCustAttr). This plugin lets you set a custom weapon model to both worldmodel and viewmodel. The weapon model persists on dropped weapons as well.

Tested it on Nosoop's [Custom Weapon X](https://github.com/nosoop/SM-TFCustomWeaponsX) and it works without any problems.

This plugin uses Nosoop's [Ninja](https://github.com/nosoop/NinjaBuild-SMPlugin) template. Easy to organize everything and build releases. I'd recommend to check it out.

Please, this is the first version of this plugin. If you find any issues, make sure to open an issue to let me know!

Also I've got no clue how to properly format this.
